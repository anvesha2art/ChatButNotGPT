Welcome to my portfolio repository! This collection showcases a diverse range of projects built using modern web technologies, ranging from interactive games to sophisticated, multimodal AI assistants. A central theme across these projects is the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid prototyping, complex feature generation, and real-time interaction, demonstrating a mastery of AI-assisted development workflows.

Projects Overview:

JARVIS Web Assistant (Multimodal AI Chatbot)
A sophisticated, persistent personal web assistant built to handle queries, code and image generation, and multimodal analysis, emulating the functionality of a digital butler.

Flappy Bird Game Clone
A complete, feature-rich clone of the classic Flappy Bird arcade game, built from the ground up using vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API.

Rank Predictor (Simulated Counseling Tool)
A dynamic web application designed to simulate the prediction of competitive exam ranks (like JEE, NEET, CLAT, CUET) based on user inputs, providing illustrative college and branch recommendations.

Category Key Technologies Used:

1)Frontend - React.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript
2)AI/ML - Google Gemini API (Generative AI)
3)Database - Firebase Firestore (Real-Time NoSQL Database)
4)Deployment - GitHub Pages, Vercel, Local Host
